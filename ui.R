Our project delves deeply into these phenomena, focusing specifically on how changes in global temperatures and precipitation patterns have corresponded with the rise in industrial activities over the past century."),
                         tags$p("Although the dataset is extensive, there may be gaps in geographic or temporal coverage. Some areas, especially remote or underdeveloped regions, may have fewer data collection points, which can lead to less reliable temperature and precipitation records. The lack of comprehensive coverage can distort our understanding of global patterns and trends. Additionally, changes in measurement technologies and techniques over time could affect the accuracy of historical data. Older records might not have been collected with the same precision or under the same standards as more recent data. Furthermore, the use of different methodologies by various data sources can make it challenging to create a consistent dataset that accurately reflects global conditions. Researchers often use interpolation methods to estimate values for missing data. However, these techniques largely depend on assumptions about the data and its distribution. Misestimations can lead to incorrect conclusions, especially in under-represented areas. Depending on the frequency of data recordings, the dataset may not effectively capture short-term fluctuations or extreme events. This limitation can affect analyses related to abrupt climate changes or anomalies, which are crucial for understanding climate variability and extremes. The relevance of the dataset depends on its currency. If data collection stopped several years ago, it might not reflect recent trends or sudden climatic shifts, which are crucial for current and future climate modeling and analysis."),

First, there's the issue of data quality and consistency. Data collected from different sources often varies in quality and can be inconsistent, which might skew our analysis. The granularity of the data also poses a problem; while we can get global-scale data, local details necessary for targeted analyses are often lacking. Further, the dataâ€™s temporal coverage can be limiting, as climate change requires long-term data to discern meaningful trends. Another significant challenge is dealing with data gaps and missing information, which are not uncommon in large datasets. These gaps can complicate trend analysis and make it difficult to create accurate models or forecasts, further complicating our efforts to address climate change effectively. There is one limitation, since we're new to the R language, our limited experience could hinder our ability to efficiently manipulate and analyze the data. This might be a limitation as mastering R is essential for effectively handling the complex data involved in our climate change project."),
