# Introduction
Climate change represents a serious global challenge, profoundly affecting every parts of Earth's climatic systems. As industrial activities have surged over the last century, so too have their impacts on global temperatures and precipitation patterns. Our research project is designed to futher analysis into these trends, focusing specifically on how changes in global temperatures and precipitation patterns have corresponded with the rise in industrial activities over the past century.

This exploration is increasingly important given the escalation in extreme weather events, which carry significant repercussions for ecosystems, public health, agriculture, and economic stability across the globe. Instances of extraordinary climatic phenomena, such as intense rainfall, severe hailstorms, frequent inland tornadoes, and unusually early nightfall, underscore the pressing need for comprehensive climate research. By understanding these changes and their drivers, our project seeks to help societies with the knowledge to enhance resilience and formulate effective adaptation strategies, addressing the urgent challenges posed by climate change.

# Main Questions:
How have global temperature anomalies evolved over the years, and what does this suggest about the pace and scale of global warming?"


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
The results of our analysis of global climate change data have important implications for governement technologists and researchers. They can use this data to innovate solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as developing more efficient renewable energy sources or advanced climate monitoring systems. Infrastructure designers can use this data to create sustainable and resilient infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather conditions, contributing to the long-term sustainability of cities. Policymakers, especially those involved in environmental law, can use this research to identify the most vulnerable areas and establish targeted regulatory frameworks. This will help shape effective climate policies and international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and promote sustainable development.

The challenges we face in this project are multifaceted. Data quality and consistency are important issues, as the quality of data from different sources varies greatly, leading to the possibility that our analysis may not be accurate. Granularity of the data is another issue; while data on a global scale is available, the lack of local details can hinder targeted analysis. There are also limits to the time coverage of the data, as climate change trends require long-term data to identify meaningful patterns. In addition, dealing with data gaps and missing information is a common challenge with large data sets, complicating trend analysis and model accuracy.

Analysis of the dataset revealed several key statistics about global land and ocean temperatures. Our graph shows the continuous increase in Temperature over time, including Temperature Anomalies and Annual Average Land Temperature, showing the increasing environmental and climate problems.

Together, our study highlights the need for coordinated sectoral efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change. By harnessing data-driven insights, we can develop innovative solutions and implement effective policies that collectively contribute to a more sustainable future.
