For the Final Project -- Data Wrangling, add the following to this code repository:

* An R script file containing the code you used to create your unified dataset 
* Your unified and cleaned CSV dataset file
* Data Nutrition Label (pdf) 


**Link: Link to your Shiny App here**

Please create the necessary files for your multi-page Shiny app in this GitHub repository. Consult the Canvas assignment for more details. Be sure to publish your app on Shinyapps.io.

When you are finished, please add the text from your introductory and concluding pages below. You might want to use this GitHub repository as part of your digital portfolio, so you want this README.md to offer a brief description of the project and key takeaways.

Feel free to delete these instructions for your final README.md file and to make your GitHub repository public if you would like others to be able to see it. 

# Introduction
Climate change is a global crisis that influences virtually every aspect of the Earth's weather systems, from average temperature fluctuations to extreme weather occurrences and long-term patterns in precipitation. Our project is designed to delve deeply into these phenomena, focusing specifically on how changes in global temperatures and precipitation patterns have corresponded with the rise in industrial activities over the past century.

The importance of these questions is underscored by the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which have profound implications for ecosystems, human health, agriculture, and economies worldwide. Recent reports of extraordinary weather events, such as unprecedented heavy rainfall, massive hail storms, inland tornadoes, and the sky that turns dark prematurely, highlight the urgent need to understand and mitigate climate change. Such extreme events disrupt lives and infrastructures, necessitating a robust analysis to aid in preparation and adaptation strategies.

Main Questions:
<br> How have global temperature anomalies evolved over the years, and what does this suggest about the pace and scale of global warming?"
