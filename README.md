# Introduction
Climate change is a global crisis that influences virtually every aspect of the Earth's weather systems, from average temperature fluctuations to extreme weather occurrences and long-term patterns in precipitation. Our project is designed to delve deeply into these phenomena, focusing specifically on how changes in global temperatures and precipitation patterns have corresponded with the rise in industrial activities over the past century.

The importance of these questions is underscored by the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which have profound implications for ecosystems, human health, agriculture, and economies worldwide. Recent reports of extraordinary weather events, such as unprecedented heavy rainfall, massive hail storms, inland tornadoes, and the sky that turns dark prematurely, highlight the urgent need to understand and mitigate climate change. Such extreme events disrupt lives and infrastructures, necessitating a robust analysis to aid in preparation and adaptation strategies.

Main Questions:
<br> How have global temperature anomalies evolved over the years, and what does this suggest about the pace and scale of global warming?"


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
The results of our analysis of global climate change data have important implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. Researchers and technologists can use this data to innovate solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as developing more efficient renewable energy sources or advanced climate monitoring systems. Infrastructure designers can use this data to create sustainable and resilient infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather conditions, contributing to the long-term sustainability of cities. Policymakers, especially those involved in environmental law, can use this research to identify the most vulnerable areas and establish targeted regulatory frameworks. This will help shape effective climate policies and international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance climate resilience, and promote sustainable development.

The challenges we face in this project are multifaceted. Data quality and consistency are important issues, as the quality of data from different sources varies greatly, leading to the possibility that our analysis may not be accurate. Granularity of the data is another issue; while data on a global scale is available, the lack of local details can hinder targeted analysis. There are also limits to the time coverage of the data, as climate change trends require long-term data to identify meaningful patterns. In addition, dealing with data gaps and missing information is a common challenge with large data sets, complicating trend analysis and model accuracy.

Analysis of the dataset revealed several key statistics about global land and ocean temperatures. Our graph shows the continuous increase in Temperature over time, including Temperature Anomalies and Annual Average Land Temperature, showing the increasing environmental and climate problems.

Together, our study highlights the need for coordinated sectoral efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change. By harnessing data-driven insights, we can develop innovative solutions and implement effective policies that collectively contribute to a more sustainable future.
